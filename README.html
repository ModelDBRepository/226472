This repository contains the reference implementation of the model
proposed in Weigenand and Schellenberger Costa et al. 2014, available

For convenience we utilize MATLAB for data processing and
plotting. Therefore the simulation comes with an additional
source-file Cortex_mex.cpp that can be compiled within MATLAB to
utilize their C++-mex interface. The easiest way to reproduce the
figures in the paper is to simply run the Create_Data() function
within MATLAB, assuming the mex interface is setup.

Afterwards simply run the respective plot functions for the different
figures. Please note that due to the stochastic nature of the
simulation the time series will differ.
